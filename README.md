# Scatter3D
A Unity project that was part of my masters thesis at the university of Newcastle.

The focus of this project is to assit data analysis in 3D space. It currently supoorts the two most common 
correlation plots: scatter and heatmap. The application emphasizes on freedom of movement when the viewing data.
